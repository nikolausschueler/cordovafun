What is it?
===========

Or, more exactly: What will this be?

An app that displays names that are supposed to be funny. It will display them in an
order that lets you guess by yourself, then an order that is supposed to be funny.
Finally, if available and if needed, it will display a solution.

Example:

```
Ender Lovemeat
```

```
Lovemeat, Ender
```

```
Love me tender
```

I originally wrote a similar app with Python and Flask,
https://github.com/nikolausschueler/sillynames. As I'm now trying to get
familiar with Apache Cordova, https://cordova.apache.org/, I chose this as an
example application.
